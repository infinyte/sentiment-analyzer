# Sentiment Analyzer - Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development path for Sentiment Analyzer. Timelines are estimates and subject to change based on community feedback and contributions.

---

## 📊 Current Status

**Status:** Sentiment + MARL + Evolution complete; the **Live Agent Pipeline (engineering Phases 3–7)** has since shipped — single-cycle orchestrator, continuous shadow harness, walk-forward validation, SSE live UI, net-of-fees expectancy analytics, and a MARL policy feeder. Exchange layer covers Crypto.com, Binance.US, Coinbase, and Alpaca plus paper and fee-realistic paper exchanges.
**Latest Release:** v3.1.0
**Last Updated:** June 2026

> ⚠️ **Two numbering schemes.** The product-roadmap phases below (Phase 4 Enhanced Analytics, Phase 5 Exchange Integration, etc.) are aspirational product tracks and are **not** the same as the engineering "Phase 3–7" labels used in the codebase and README for the live-agent pipeline. The engineering pipeline is summarized in the milestone section immediately below; the product tracks follow it.

## ✅ Latest Milestone: Live Agent Pipeline (engineering Phases 3–7) — Complete

Turns the research stack (sentiment + MARL + evolution) into a measurable, overfitting-guarded paper track record. See the README "Phase 4–7: Live Agent Pipeline" section and `CLAUDE.md` for full detail.

- [x] **Phase 3 — Trading Agent Orchestrator** (`services/agent/trading-orchestrator.ts`): single decision cycle, transparent asymmetric policy, routes through safety-guarded `TradingService` onto the shared exchange; pluggable Static/Sentiment signal sources
- [x] **Phase 4 — Shadow Harness** (`services/agent/shadow-harness.ts`): interval-driven continuous runner, overlap-guarded, in-memory cycle history; pair with `SHADOW_MODE=true`
- [x] **Phase 5 — Walk-Forward Validation** (`services/analytics/walk-forward.ts`): rolling IS/OOS windows, same policy + net-of-fees scoring as production, reports walk-forward efficiency
- [x] **Phase 6 — SSE Live UI**: `GET /api/shadow/stream` consumed by the `ShadowHarnessDashboard` "Shadow Live" tab
- [x] **Phase 7 — MARL Policy Feeder** (`services/agent/marl-policy-feeder.ts`): maps the best evolved genome onto live `PolicyParams`
- [x] **Net-of-fees expectancy analytics** (`services/analytics/expectancy.ts`, `/api/paper/*`) and the **RealisticPaperExchange** with provider fee presets + slippage
- [x] **Tournament scheduling & live control** (`/api/tournaments/*` + schedules) with SSE streams
- [x] **DI container (tsyringe) + repository layer** refactor; two **GA MCP servers** (genetic-ops, agent-manager)
